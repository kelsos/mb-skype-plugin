[Abandoned] Skype Now Playing (Plugin for MusicBee)
=======================
This project is probably not functioning anymore and is not in any way actively developed or maintained.


This is a small plugin to update the Skype mood with the track currently playing in MusicBee.

Previous versions required Skype4COM library to function, however the latest repository does not require it.
